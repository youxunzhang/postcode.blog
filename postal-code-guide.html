    <h2>Common Questions & FAQ</h2>
    
    <div>
        <h3>What is the difference between a postal code and a ZIP code?</h3>
        <p>Postal Code is a general term used internationally to describe codes that help sort and deliver mail. ZIP Code is a specific type of postal code used in the United States. "ZIP" stands for "Zone Improvement Plan" and was introduced by the US Postal Service in 1963.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>How many digits are in a ZIP code?</h3>
        <p>US ZIP codes have 5 digits in their basic format (e.g., 12345). Extended ZIP codes, known as ZIP+4, add an additional 4 digits separated by a hyphen (e.g., 12345-6789).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3>How do I find my postal code?</h3>
        <p>You can find your postal code by using online search tools, official postal service websites, Google search, maps applications, visiting your local post office, or checking phone directories.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3>Can I find a city and state by ZIP code?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can often determine the general city and state from a US ZIP code. The first digit of a ZIP code indicates a group of states, and the second and third digits narrow down the region.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3>What does an invalid postal code mean?</h3>
        <p>An invalid postal code typically means the code doesn't follow the correct format for that country, doesn't exist in the postal system, or there's a typographical error.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3>Are postal codes the same worldwide?</h3>
        <p>No, postal codes are not the same worldwide. Each country has its own postal code system with different formats, lengths, and structures.</p>
